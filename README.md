# About
These are the nix files for my setup. The main focus and initial host (*amber*) will be an old desktop PC, repurposed as a server for self-hosting experimentations. 

Don't take anything in here as gospel, I'm a complete noob working my way through Nix, NixOS and Selfhosting in general one-by-one.
